This repository contains the source for a C# .NET library with full support for the Session Initiation Protocol [(SIP)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261) and the Real-time Transport Protocol [(RTP)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3550). 

**This library does NOT provide any media (audio and video) handling. For Windows the companion [SIPSorceryMedia](https://github.com/sipsorcery/sipsorcery-media) library provides audio & video functions for rendering & capture. This project can be used for SIP signalling and to send and receive RTP packets.**

**NEW (Feb/Mar 2020)**: Pre-release support for Web Real-Time Communication [(WebRTC)](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/) for early adopters. See [Getting Started WebRTC](#getting-started-webrtc).

## Installation

The library is compliant with .NET Standard 2.0, .Net Core 3.1 and .NET Framework 4.6. It is available via NuGet.

For .NET Core:

````bash
dotnet add package SIPSorcery
````

With Visual Studio Package Manager Console (or search for [SIPSorcery on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SIPSorcery/)):

````ps1
Install-Package SIPSorcery
````

#### SIPSorceryMedia Install

.NET Core does not provide any audio or video capture capabilities nor any audio rendering function (UWP does and there are some [tricks](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2017/01/25/calling-windows-10-apis-desktop-application/) to get at its API but it's fragile). A lot of the uses for SIP and WebRTC revolve around such capabilities and functions. A companion Windows specific library which fills this gap is maintained at [SIPSorceryMedia](https://github.com/sipsorcery/sipsorcery-media). For non-Windows applications there is no known .NET Core library that provides audio and video functions.

The [RtpAVSession](https://github.com/sipsorcery/sipsorcery-media/blob/master/src/RtpAVSession/RtpAVSession.cs) class from the `SIPSorceryMedia` library wraps the audio and video functions and integrates with the [SIPUserAgent](https://sipsorcery.github.io/sipsorcery/api/SIPSorcery.SIP.App.SIPUserAgent.html) class for ease of use.

**Note that the `RtpAVSession` class is only available as a pre-release in version 4.0.28-pre and greater.**

The `SIPSorceryMedia` library is compliant with .NET Core 3.1. It is available via NuGet:

For .NET Core:

````bash
dotnet add package SIPSorceryMedia -v 4.0.28-pre
````

With Visual Studio Package Manager Console (or search for [SIPSorceryMedia on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SIPSorceryMedia/)):

````ps1
Install-Package SIPSorceryMedia -v 4.0.28-pre
````

## Documentation

Class reference documentation and articles explaining common usage are available at [https://sipsorcery.github.io/sipsorcery/](https://sipsorcery.github.io/sipsorcery/).

## Getting Started SIP/VoIP

The simplest possible example to place an audio-only SIP call is shown below. This example relies on the Windows specific `SIPSorceryMedia` library to play the received audio.

````bash
dotnet new console --name SIPGetStarted
cd SIPGetStarted
dotnet add package SIPSorcery -v 4.0.28-pre
dotnet add package SIPSorceryMedia -v 4.0.28-pre
edit Program.cs and paste in the contents below
dotnet run
````

````csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Sockets;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using SIPSorcery.SIP;
using SIPSorcery.SIP.App;
using SIPSorcery.Media;

namespace SIPGetStarted
{
    class Program
    {
         private static string DESTINATION = "time@sipsorcery.com";
        
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("SIP Get Started");
            
            var sipTransport = new SIPTransport();
            var userAgent = new SIPUserAgent(sipTransport, null);
            var rtpSession = new RtpAVSession(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, new AudioOptions { AudioSource = AudioSourcesEnum.Microphone }, null);

            // Place the call and wait for the result.
            bool callResult = await userAgent.Call(DESTINATION, null, null, rtpSession);
            Console.WriteLine($"Call result {((callResult) ? "success" : "failure")}.");
        }
    }
}
````

The [GetStarted](https://github.com/sipsorcery/sipsorcery/tree/master/examples/GetStarted) example contains the full source and project file for the example above.

The three key classes in the above example are described in dedicated articles:

 - [SIPTransport](https://sipsorcery.github.io/sipsorcery/articles/transport.html),
 - [SIPUserAgent](https://sipsorcery.github.io/sipsorcery/articles/sipuseragent.html),
 - [RTPSession](https://sipsorcery.github.io/sipsorcery/articles/rtpsession.html) base class for `RtpAVSession`.

The [examples folder](https://github.com/sipsorcery/sipsorcery/tree/master/examples) contains sample code to demonstrate other common SIP use cases such as:

## Getting Started WebRTC

The core of the code required to establish a WebRTC connection is demonstrated below. The code shown will build but will not establish a connection due to no mechanism to exchange the SDP offer and answer between peers. A full working example with a web socket signalling mechanism is available in the [WebRTCTestPatternServer](https://github.com/sipsorcery/sipsorcery/tree/master/examples/WebRTCTestPatternServer) example.

````bash
dotnet new console --name WebRTCGetStarted

dotnet add package SIPSorceryMedia -v 4.0.28-pre

The key class for using WebRTC is described in this article:
 
  - [WebRTCSession](https://sipsorcery.github.io/sipsorcery/articles/webrtcsession.html)

The full list of WebRTC examples available is:

 - [WebRTCTestPatternServer](https://github.com/sipsorcery/sipsorcery/tree/master/examples/WebRTCTestPatternServer): The simplest example. This program serves up a test pattern video stream to a WebRTC peer.
 - [WebRTCServer](https://github.com/sipsorcery/sipsorcery/tree/master/examples/WebRTCServer): This example extends the test pattern example and can act as a media source for a peer. It has two source options:
   - An mp4 file.
   - Capture devices (webcam and microphone).
 The example includes an html file which runs in a Browser and will connect to a sample program running on the same machine.
- [WebRTCReceiver](https://github.com/sipsorcery/sipsorcery/tree/master/examples/WebRTCReceiver): A receive only example. It attempts to connect to a WebRTC peer and display the video stream that it receives.

**The WebRtcSession class and all WebRTC functionality in this library are still under heavy development. There are large blocks of functionality still missing, particularly ICE and codec support. All issues and PR's are very welcome.**
