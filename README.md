This repository contains the source for a C# .NET library with full support for the Session Initiation Protocol [(SIP)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261) and the Real-time Transport Protocol [(RTP)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3550) including IPv6 support. In addition 
there is some support for Web Real-Time Communication [(WebRTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC) and a number of related protocols such as RTSP.

This library does NOT provide any media (audio and video) handling. There are some limited capabilities in the separate [SIPSorcery.Media](https://github.com/sipsorcery/sipsorcery-media) project but they are Windows specific and not suitable for production. This project can be used for SIP signalling and to send and receive RTP packets. To playback audio/video additional libraries such as [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio) are required.

## Installation

The library is compliant with .NET Standard 2.0, .Net Core 3.0 and .NET Framework 4.5.2. It is available via NuGet.

For .NET Core:

````bash
dotnet add package SIPSorcery
````

With Visual Studio Package Manager Console (or search for [SIPSorcery on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SIPSorcery/)):

````ps1
Install-Package SIPSorcery
````

## Documentation

Class reference documentation and articles explaining common usage are available at [https://sipsorcery.github.io/sipsorcery/](https://sipsorcery.github.io/sipsorcery/).

## Getting Started

The [examples folder](https://github.com/sipsorcery/sipsorcery/tree/master/examples) contains full sample code designed to demonstrate some common use cases. The [GetStarted](https://github.com/sipsorcery/sipsorcery/tree/master/examples/GetStarted) example which places a SIP call to `sip:time@sipsorcery.com` is the best place to start and the main program is shown below.

#### SIP Transport Layer

To use the SIP functionality the first step is to initialise the `SIPTransport` class. It takes care of things like retransmitting requests and responses, DNS resolution, selecting the next hop for requests, matching SIP messages to transactions and more.

The `SIPTransport` class can have multiple SIP channels added to it. A SIP channel is roughly the equivalent to the HTTP connection between a Web Browser and Server. It expects all packets received to be either a SIP request or response. The types of SIP channels supported are UDP, TCP, TLS and Web Sockets.

The code below shows how to create a `SIPTransport` instance and add a single UDP channel to it. If no channel is added to the transport it will attempt to create them on demand.

````csharp
var sipTransport = new SIPTransport();
var sipChannel = new SIPUDPChannel(IPAddress.Loopback, 5060);
sipTransport.AddSIPChannel(sipChannel);
````

To shutdown the `SIPTransport` use:

````csharp
sipTransport.Shutdown();
````

#### SIP User Agent and RTP Session

The easiest way to make use of the SIP Transport layer is to use it with a `SIPUserAgent` object. The `SIPUserAgent` takes care of the SIP signalling for most common SIP functions. An `RTPMediaSession` is needed to handle the sending and receiving of `RTP` packets and the media (audio/video) information within them.

````csharp
var userAgent = new SIPUserAgent(sipTransport, null);
var rtpSession = new RTPMediaSession((int)SDPMediaFormatsEnum.PCMU, AddressFamily.InterNetwork);
````

A call can then be placed using the `SIPUserAgent.Call` method and if successfully answered then sampling of the local audio input device can be started.

````csharp
// Place the call and wait for the result.
bool callResult = await userAgent.Call(DESTINATION, null, null, rtpSession);

if(callResult)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Call attempt successful.");
	microphone.StartRecording();
}
else
{
	Console.WriteLine("Call attempt failed.");
}
````
