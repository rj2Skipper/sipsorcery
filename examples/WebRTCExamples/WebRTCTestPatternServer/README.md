**Usage**

This example generates a test pattern video stream and sends it to any WebRTC peers that connect.

**NOTE**: The test pattern is encoded using the separate `SIPSorceryMedia` library which is Windows specific.

You will need `.Net Core` installed.

- Start the test application on Windows using:

`dotnet run`

- Open the `webrtc.html` in a browser and click `Start` and the test pattern should appear.
